# nfl-draft-probability

Use a python script to scrape nfl draft data and attempt to build a model that can predict the following: if a player will be drafted, what round a player will be drafted, and what team the player will go to.

This will be half `.py` script for the scraping portion and half `.ipynb` for the exploratory data work.
